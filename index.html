          I make hybrid <a class="cream-hover" href="https://mmansour.space" target="_blank">poem-websites</a>, designing and developing the frontend while writing the text and editing between VS Code, Audacity, and Figma simultaneously. I submitted this collection of pieces made between 2023 and 2025 as my portfolio to study with the <a class="cream-hover" href="https://digitale-grafik.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klasse Digitale Grafik</a> and develop over the next few years in the master's project.

          As a longtime community member of the visual research tool <a class="cream-hover" href="https://are.na"
                target="_blank">Are.na</a>, I was really excited to lead an overhaul of the platform's <a class="cream-hover" href="https://help.are.na/docs/" target="_blank">help
                documentation</a> timed with the release of their new web client. The project included a full restructuring of their information architecture within a new content management system, revising and expanding the copy along for new instructional articles and resources.

        <h2><span class="dropdown-icon">▧</span>Data Storytelling</h2>

          <p>
       I collaborated in-house with market researchers at <a class="cream-hover" href="https://www.statista.com/" target="_blank">Statista</a>, covering global energy trade, renewable resources, and Latin American agriculture. My main task was writing and editing a high volume of <a class="cream-hover" href="#" target="_blank">industry reports</a> for B2B audiences to provide narrative context and searchable text content for data visualizations and graphs.

        <h2><span class="dropdown-icon">▧</span>Teaching & Community</h2>

          <p>
            Bringing a background in language education, I teach creative code and net art through the lens of media literacy. Recently, I joined for a day of guest teaching in a Kommunikationsdesign foundations course at Burg Halle, and organized the Hamburg edition of HTML Day as part of a worldwide event. A complete list of past activities can be found below in my artistic CV.
