Morgan Mansour {dot} com

is my soft, open bulletin board for collaborations -- commercial and communal.

Some things I'd happy to exchange right now:


Designing and coding websites and interfaces, bringing background in content strategy to product teams and agencies/consultancies.

-- Werkstudent.in, 10-20 hours, Hamburg (on-site) or Berlin (hybrid/remote)

//

Writing and editing help documentation, education content, microcopy and localization (DE/FR to EN) for digital tools and projects

-- Freelance, Hamburg/remote

//

Making small, static sites on a sliding scale basis for cultural workers, non-profits, etc. with (optional) lessons on how to keep building it independently

-- Project-based, online or together in person

//

Language tandem English for French, conversation on art, geopolitics, good books, and where to eat.

-- Over coffee or on the telephone
